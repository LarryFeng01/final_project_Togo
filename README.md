#Togo

Hello! This is my final project on Togo. At first I had chosen Ethiopia as my LMIC. After loading the raster for the simple feature object, however, I noticed that the country is just way too big. I could not find time to run the rasters since I needed my laptop everyday for class. So, enjoy this project on the Western African Country, Togo.
